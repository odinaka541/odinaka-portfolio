it takes a lot of sheer will to take something from imagination to reality. a lot.
it's long. it's frustrating. it's lonely. it's confusing. but by God, it's rewarding when it clicks. just need to stick around long enough, and believe in it hard enough to see results. want to bet you'll see the beauties of lemina soon?
