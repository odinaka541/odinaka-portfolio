can't believe it's just 11pm. i've covered a lot of ground, and i have a lot more to go. nothing like a good law drama to keep me engaged and power through.
i lowkey enjoy law a bit much. well, i enjot the dramatizatio of law. i think i might fall asleep in a courtroom if i actually found myself in one. 
Suits, The Good Fight, even Succession (maybe not) - good shows. 
now, back to feeling like a "quintessential tech genius."
