now, if you do make it to this point of my blitz thoughts, i am inviting you for the Immersion Camp Meeting happening in Abuja, Nigeria. 10th - 14th of December, 2025.
if you can't make that one, then, i'm also inviting you for the Urgency Camp Meeting. Enugu, Nigeria. 14th to 18th of December, 2025.

where was i again? yes, building and blitzing. i really don't care how many people read these things lol. doing it for two reasons - posterity and clarity. years down the line, this would be my proof for the "he's so lucky" gang. it wasn't luck. it was divine and it was intentional. other than that, my mind becomes clearer when i write. i like writing.

come for camp meeting! join me build and blitz tonight. we can do 3, 4 hours. let's dance.

(note to self - maybe add gifs or stickers.)
