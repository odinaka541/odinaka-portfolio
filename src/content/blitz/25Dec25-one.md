i have found a new appreciation for suffering; for antifragility. i found it because of AI. writing a book and i realise just how easy it is to, "finish this page for me. make sure the tone and voice is consistent." but, i can't. if i do, what then is my point? what then is man?

i'm not saying enjoy suffering. i am saying, embrace it.

i should write something on antifragility (after i'm done with time, the guitar, physics. boy)
boy...
