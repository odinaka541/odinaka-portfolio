i hit a block. i can't decide the elements to go in certain sections, and it's annoying. i knew i shouldn't have slept. lol.

i built the company profile cards and i feel good about the work i did for them. sent them out for vetting. hoping they come back positive.

the natural workflow is deal sourcing - due diligence - invest and track - exit. deal sourcing is fine. need something efficient for dd. current iteration doesn't feel right yet. will make it so in a bit. i should be careful not to give too much away in terms of the actual technical prowess for what i'm building lol. oh well.
