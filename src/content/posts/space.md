one of my favourite things to get lost in thought about is space - outer space. you could say i’m obsessed. like most people i dreamt about being an astronaut (a formula one driver too, but that’s for some other time). i thought about the vast beauties in space; the nebulas and cosmic patterns. i thought about how incredibly massive the universe is. imagine Earth to be a tiny grain of sand in a bucket of sand. the bucket of sand is on a beach. there are other buckets of sand on that beach. now imagine how many beaches there are on Earth. imagine all of that and you still would be roughly 10 to the 70th power off, in terms of the true scale of the universe. try punching that in a calculator. that’s how big the universe really is. mind-melting.

i enjoy space not only for its beauty, but for the truth that it unravels - if it was created, there is a creator. if it exists, and at this much scale and sophistication, someone must have created it. someone must have designed the rings of Saturn, the “fingers“ of the pillars of creation, the mystic mountain, the precision of the solar system, the vast nebulas. and someone did. God did. beauty at this scale is too intentional to be ignored. it marvels me.

it inspires me. it lights a fuse in me. a fuse of exploration; of humility; of outright passion and hunger. this piece wasn’t intended to be intellectual. just unrelenting. time to watch Interstellar for the umpteenth time lol. there is so much more.

so much more.
