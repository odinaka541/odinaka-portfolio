i know you will see this. at least, i hope you do. 
my name is Odinaka. i love money - the concept of it. i also love building out technical systems that make it easier to work with money. this drove me into studying quantitative finance models. i have been in the PE scene since the day i learned people could make money just flipping companies. this really drove me to pursue a CFA membership. i love the entrepreneurial journey as well. i have battle scars to prove i'm worth my salt as an entrepreneur. the most relevant i have to offer on this is https://lemina.co. i built out a native platform for angel investors and venture capitalists alike. everything they could possibly need, all on one platform.
i write well too. quite well. i possess a singular trait that affords me the ability to bring to life scenarios i desire to see, just with the words i speak. the only way for you to understand this is to have me speak. 
i believe i posssess a most unique perspective on the subject matter of PE, VC, investing and everything in between. i dare go an extra mile and say i am the perfect candidate for your fund. if the credentials above don't convince you, and the website and information i have provided still is not enough, i assure you - the drive and hunger to succeed is enough.
