ok. i'm pulling an all-nighter. i love these. i might have implied that a feature for lemina.co was ready, when, in fact, it was more a 60% readiness. time to build it in time to demo for the investors. truth is, i could've finished it a while ago, but i just wanted the investors to spend on the product first, but i delivered. this is fun. let's dance.

(now, i want to add a time stamp to these posts, so i can actually treat these posts as my own twitter feed. or better still, i can create a clean separation. my more intellectual thoughts in one page, then everything else in the other. i like that more. makes people know there can be a serious side to me lol. well, there usually always is. let's dance.)
