"artists don't just admire art. they have reasons why they do too." i thought about those words again, after hearing them for the first time by a friend a long time ago. 

she also did go on to call me an artist. i was taken back by the words. not that i have reasons for admiring ***art***, but that i was one - an artist. i've never been an artist in the traditional sense, but i've always enjoyed ***living*** it. i don't mean modern art. i mean life.
i mean, how the setting sun beams through the spaces between a tree's leaves. how the sound of a bird's wings beat against the air. how the different spices in food mix to create something new. how cells are so intricately knit together to create the skin of a body. how the stars are so far away, yet so close. how the sun is so bright, yet so warm.

this isn't meant to be a long piece. just a quick thought.

maybe i am an artist. but i really can't paint. the one thing i do know is i enjoy the art around me - the art of life. i can tell you why, like my friend insinuated, but let's leave that for some other time.
