1 million seconds is approximately 11.6 days. that’s long enough for a good vacation (i think. i’ve never been on one.) 1 billion seconds is 31.7 years. that’s about one-third the lives most people will live. one-third! 1 trillion seconds is 31,700 years. if you were to watch Avengers: Endgame (just because i saw it recently) from the start to the end nonstop (credits included) for 31700 years, you would finish the movie 93 million times approximately.

Mansa Musa was a Malian king with wealth so vast, it’s said he gave away gold ingots to travellers. how much was he worth? $400-600B. then, there was king Solomon. as someone put it, “do you know how rich you had to have been to have gotten married to 700 wives and sustain each marriage for years?” and the richest man today is worth some $200B. yet, for all the wealth these men attained (or will attain), the difference to $1T is so astronomical that our brains don’t truly grasp it.

that’s not the bit that gets to me. the bit that gets to me is how, incredibly, a certain Nazarene tells us that for even $1T, something is worth more. your soul. i mean, think about it - if i told you i was going to give you $1T right now and showed you proof too, you’d be onboard, no? what if i added the condition that you wouldn’t wake the next day. would you still want it? it’s not just about money either.

well, i thought in mind-boggling relatives today, and it filled me with awe and a renewed appreciation of the things that matter. the person that truly matter too.

that said, i am on my way to mind-boggling levels though.
