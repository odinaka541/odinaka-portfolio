i read a lot. i write a lot too. i share a lot too. i just never do any of the last two in public. but for posterity sake, i’ll leave as much as i can, as often as i can.

i was with a friend some time ago, and she saw a folder on my phone with only two apps, "loewy." i explained the life and work of Raymond Loewy. he's probably Steve Jobs' biggest influence, but that depends on who you ask.

Loewy's work might be the reason for that saying, "Convenience is the modern man's drug." (don't come for me if you've never heard it before lmao). his designs were so aesthetically pleasing that an entire industry was built off his principles.

you're dependent on his work too. how you perceive the modern world is tied to his principles. everyone wants "sleek and convenient." ui/ux designers want to make everything as intuitive and easy-to-follow as possible.

car owners prefer the curvier, faster type. users want answers, faster and with better type font lol. logos, cars, refrigerators, bridges, city layouts, planes. Loewy.

i love Loewy. not so much a fan on the convenience side. do boring things. get bored. watch the sun set, not because it's a blockbuster movie, but because it's healing. go on walks for the fun of it. leave the car at home. oh, well. i'll probably rewrite this some other time.

(ps: the two apps were claude and chatgpt.)
