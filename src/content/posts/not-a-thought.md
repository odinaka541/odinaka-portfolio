this is not really a thought like the others. i just wanted to unburden a bit.

i was inspired to get into this lifestyle of "quintessential tech genius" by Stark, Zuckerberg in The Social Network and a few others. so, true to the heart of "quintessential tech genius," i have a blog no one may probably read (i don't mind). typing another post into a CLI, anime open, IDE for Lemina open, 6am on a Sunday. brilliant.
i was almost drawn into the trap of feeling down. building a startup can get you that way sometimes. but on other days, you can't get enough of it. it's annoying, but fun. well, nothing prayer couldn't help with anyways. also, i saw people who were pursuing the same idea i have for lemina.co doing big things. so, who's to say the same isn't waiting for lemina? life, really, is for the living. and i intend to live. live!
i completely intend on praying with all my heart later in church today. i also intend on dancing and shaking the weariness away. it really is too late for me to fail now. it is.
so many "i's."

God is good.
