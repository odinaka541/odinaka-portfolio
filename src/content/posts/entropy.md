it is a constant beautiful in itself, and even more beautiful when you realise how much our lives are affected by it.

it was the first thing that came to my mind yesterday when i stepped into my room after weeks of travelling. the room was a mess.

entropy, simply put, is an indicator that everything will always tend towards disordeliness; towards chaos. think of it this way - why doesn’t liquid water just stay one place unless you put it in a container? why does it always flow, looking for crevices or cracks, paths to flow through? the same reason for that phenomenon is the same reason time “flows.” it’s also the same reason you can arrange a room in the morning - neat and tidy - and before the day’s done, it’s a mess. it probably wasn’t your plan to mess up the room, but entropy doesn’t care. oh, it’s also the reason the Sun swallows the Earth a few billion years from now, but let’s not talk about that.

i like entropy because it’s predictive. you can almost always tell what’s going to happen in the end, and you work your way from there. in the end, everything ends. everything spirals progressively, grows older, becomes “more.” nothing should ever become less. it’s unnatural. your body gets older. you get wiser. your faith in God grows deeper, more profound. entropy is a powerful predictor that there’d always be more.

so, yes, i had a broom in hand when i walked through the door into my room.
